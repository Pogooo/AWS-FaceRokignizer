# Introduction

Before you run the dotnet project, copy the credentials.example file to the root folder with name 'credentials'. You have to define your own aws key and its ID in the file.

In the project's wwwroot folder you have to install node packages with the following command:

```
npm i
```

If you use Linux, install the the [dotnet-sdk](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-current) package and you can build .NET applications.


# Run the project

The application runs on 5000 on http and 5001 https ports.

If you use Linux, in the project's folder run the 'dotnet run' command.
